#bowie-post-commit

##What even is this?
You made some changes in a project, so you go ahead and commit them, right?

But *what if* you could make the process of committing so much more rewarding?

Fear not - this post-commit git hook solves that problem! And lucky for you, all you have to do is copy **post-commit** into the .git/hooks/ directory of your project.

When you do that, you'll be told about your very important ♫*ch-ch-ch-ch-changes*♫ every time you commit!


##Disclaimer
You will need a Mac with the **afplay** command for this hook to work (the man page is dated February 13th, 2007, so any recent Mac with recent software will work).
